#Prime Solo Project: Search & Rescue - A Dog Adoption Aid

###Application Overview

FSAide Expense Tracker is a full stack (MEAN stack) Javascript-based web application that allows users to record and save expenses for their Flexible Spending Account.

The user logs in and then enters plan year information(e.g. plan year beginning-end dates and dollar amount flexed) on the Plan Year Information page, which is then stored in the database. Then on the Enter Expenses page the user enters expense information along with an image of the receipt. The expenses are also stored in the database and then retrieved and displayed on the View Expenses page.
